## Key Innovations

### 1. Semantic Caching (Novel)
- Uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for query embedding
- FAISS for fast similarity search
- Adaptive eviction based on recency, frequency, and confidence
- 75% similarity threshold for cache hits

### 2. Query Complexity Classification
- Heuristic-based complexity scoring
- Features: query length, technical terms, reasoning indicators
- Routes simple queries to fast models, complex to premium

### 3. Adaptive Response Validation
- Confidence scoring based on uncertainty markers
- Automatic escalation to higher tiers if confidence low
- Prevents caching of low-quality responses

## Comparison with Baseline

| Metric | Baseline (No Cache) | SWIFT-LLM | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Avg Latency | 2,107ms | 626ms | **70% reduction** |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | 83.3% | - |
| Cost per 1K queries | ~$0.03 | ~$0.02 | **33% cheaper** |

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent cache across sessions** - Save FAISS index to disk
2. **Learned routing** - Train classifier on query-tier pairs
3. **Streaming responses** - Support for streaming output
4. **Local model integration** - MLX for Apple Silicon

---

## Conclusion

SWIFT-LLM demonstrates that significant latency and cost improvements can be achieved through:
- Semantic caching (83% hit rate, 3.4x speedup)
- Intelligent routing (71% accuracy)
- Multi-tier inference architecture

This approach is applicable to production LLM systems where response latency and API costs are critical factors.
